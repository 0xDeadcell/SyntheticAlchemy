# SyntheticAlchemy - Video Q&A with AI
Have an AI watch and listen to a video for you so you can ask questions to it!


<img src="./static/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" align="center" width="200" />

SyntheticAlchemy is a web application that allows users to upload a video and ask questions about its content. Audio is transcribed with OpenAIs Whisper, and Tesseract is used to transcribe text shown on screen in the videos. To prevent oversaturation of text from translating multiple frames per second, I just limited it to 1 frame per video second.

*Note:* Currently submitting YouTube URLs are not working, but they are in the works, I just need to use a different python module or version...

Plans:
[x] Move from Google Cloud to self hosting for transcription services to save costs
[x] Vectorize/Rank pieces of data prior to submittion to OpenAI to reduce token count and cost.
[ ] YouTube URL support (in progress)
[ ] Redis database to store queries and transcriptions (in progress)
[ ] ElevenLabs API support
    [ ] Play back the responses to your questions with a realistic voice!
    [ ] For videos that are sufficiently long enough support the responses to be played back with their voice 
[ ] Adding/storing API keys via web interface
[ ] Speech-To-Text, to talk to your video, and have it answer you back.
